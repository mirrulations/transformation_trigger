'''
This function creates an OpenSearch client. If the environment variables OPENSEARCH_HOST if OPENSEARCH_PORT are not
set, an error is raised. If the host is set to 'localhost', the client is created with basic authentication. Otherwise,
the client is created with AWS request signing. The function returns the OpenSearch client.

All code that depends on whether we are connecting to a local or production OpenSearch instance is inside of this function.
Outside of the function, interaction with the client is the same regardless of the environment.
